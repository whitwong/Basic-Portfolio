				<p>Hello! My name is Whitney Wong. I grew up in Plano, TX and graduated from The University of Texas at Austin. I completed my degree in Biomedical Engineering in 2013 and currently work at a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility as a process engineer. Even though I don't have an educational background in programming or design, I was drawn to web development and all the opportunities it provides. I started learning HTML and CSS on my own. After a few months, I decided that I needed to take it a step further and applied to enroll in The Coding Bootcamp at UT and was accepted! Now I'm attending classes and am motivated more than ever to broaden my knowledge and skills so that I can become a full-stack web developer (aka <strong>The Unicorn</strong>).</p>
				<p>Outside of work and classes, my main interests are in snowboarding, wakeboarding, and hiking. Learning to board (snow or water) was painful and very frustrating at times, but once you start getting the feel for riding it's addicting. Another interest I have is that I want to travel the world more. On my to-see list, I have:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Australia</li>
					<li>New Zealand</li>
					<li>Japan</li>
					<li>Singapore</li>
					<li>Peru</li>
				</ul>
				<p>It's a pleasure to introduce myself, and I hope I have the opportunity to hear from you! To reach me, click <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">here</a> select the Contact link at the top of the page.</p>
